# *** Threads***


Task: Create a windowed application that generates a set
prime numbers in the range specified by the user.
If no lower bound is specified, thread c starts at 2.
If no upper bound is specified, generation occurs before the application terminates. Use the threading mechanism. The numbers should be displayed in the window
interface.
Add to the first job a thread that generates
set of Fibonacci numbers. Numbers should be displayed
in the window interface.
Add buttons to the second task for complete
stopping each of the threads. One button for one
flow. If the user clicked on the stop button,
the thread stops running completely.


Works in VisualStudio 2019, .Net Framework 5.0
